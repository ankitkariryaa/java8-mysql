	<h3>Analytics Dashboards</h3>
	<p>When you log in with the admin account that you created on
		application setup, you will see a number of demo dashboard links on
		this index page. Each of these dashboard showcases different realKD
		algorithms on different datasets. In particular, each dashboard
		contains (a subset of) the following default realKD algorithms that
		can be applied to a different dataset:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Association Discovery by Beamsearch</li>
		<li>Association Discovery by Direct Pattern Sampling</li>
		<li>(Generalized) Subgroup Discovery by Beamsearch</li>
		<li>(Generalized) Subgroup Discovery by Direct Pattern Sampling</li>
		<li>(Generalized) Subgroup Discovery by <a
			href="http://www.patternsthatmatter.org/dssd">Diverse Subgroup
				Set Discovery</a>.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		In particular, subgroup discovery can be performed with the novel <a
			href="http://eda.mmci.uni-saarland.de/cjs">Jensen-Shannon
			divergence</a>.
	</p>

	<h3>Studies</h3>
	<p>
		For a demonstration of Creedo user studies, login with your admin
		account, open the administration frame, and find under studies the
		entry <i>forsied_demo_study</i>. The option <i>State</i> underneath
		this entry allows you to toggle between different study states. Choose
		the option <i>TRIAL</i> to activate this study.
	</p>
	<p>Then you can logout and login again with one of the following
		user accounts (password: creedo):</p>
	<ul>
		<li>berta@realkd.org</li>
		<li>bob@realkd.org</li>
		<li>jane@realkd.org</li>
		<li>joe@realkd.org</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		You will now find a new section of dashboards called <i>Study
			Assignments</i> with links corresponding to trial assignments in active
		studies. After you participated in the trial phase with all demo
		users, you can go ahead and switch the study state to <i>EVALUATE</i>
		using an admin account. Subsequently, when you log in with demo users,
		you will now see evaluation assignments.
