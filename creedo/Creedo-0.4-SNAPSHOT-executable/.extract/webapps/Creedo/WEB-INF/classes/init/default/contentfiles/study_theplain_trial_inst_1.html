					As a new employee of the Data Science Department of the government
					of <b>The Plain</b>, you have to get familiar with the
					socio-economics status of your country. Go on and use our data
					mining tool to discover key phenomena from <b>The Plain</b>'s
					socio-economic data. The data consists of the socio-economic
					records of 1000 representative inhabitant samples of your country.

			The data mining tool will propose statements about the data, and
			measures associativity among the statements. Such information is
			summarized in graphic representations (<b>patterns</b>) like the
			figure below:

			<ul class="col-lg-5">
				<li><p>Sec.1 states whether the statements are positively
						or negatively associated.</p></li>
				<li><p>Sec.2 lists the considered statements, along with
						the frequency (proportion of inhabitants) that each individual
						statement holds true.</p></li>
				<li><p>Sec.3 visualizes the difference between the expected
						frequency (blue bar) and the actual frequency (red bar) of the
						statements. The larger the difference the stronger the
						positive/negative association is.</p></li>
			</ul>

		<p>Patterns can assist you to identify the socio-economic
			phenomena in the data. For example, the pattern above can be
			interpreted as: "very rich inhabitants in the country are insecure
			about their health, which makes them unhappy". What is your
			interpretation?</p>
